Creates a preliminary link file recording the paths and hashes of the
passed materials and signs it with the passed functionary’s key.

### Synopsis

Creates a preliminary link file recording the paths and hashes of the
passed materials and signs it with the passed functionary’s key.
The resulting link file is stored as ‘.<name>.<keyid prefix>.link-unfinished’.

```
in-toto record start [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -h, --help                    help for start
  -m, --materials stringArray   Paths to files or directories, whose paths and hashes
                                are stored in the resulting link metadata before the
                                command is executed. Symlinks are followed.
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
  -c, --cert string                 Path to a PEM formatted certificate that corresponds
                                    with the provided key.
  -e, --exclude stringArray         Path patterns to match paths that should not be recorded as 
                                    ‘materials’ or ‘products’. Passed patterns override patterns defined
                                    in environment variables or config files. See Config docs for details.
  -k, --key string                  Path to a private key file to sign the resulting link metadata.
                                    The keyid prefix is used as an infix for the link metadata filename,
                                    i.e. ‘<name>.<keyid prefix>.link’. See ‘–key-type’ for available
                                    formats. Passing one of ‘–key’ or ‘–gpg’ is required.
  -l, --lstrip-paths stringArray    Path prefixes used to left-strip artifact paths before storing
                                    them to the resulting link metadata. If multiple prefixes
                                    are specified, only a single prefix can match the path of
                                    any artifact and that is then left-stripped. All prefixes
                                    are checked to ensure none of them are a left substring
                                    of another.
  -d, --metadata-directory string   Directory to store link metadata (default "./")
  -n, --name string                 Name for the resulting link metadata file.
                                    It is also used to associate the link with a step defined
                                    in an in-toto layout.
```
